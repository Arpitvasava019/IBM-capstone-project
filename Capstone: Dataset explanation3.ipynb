Aside from tourist, Toronto is also a hub of giant offices. With this type of popularity it is hard to find food and place to sell it.I will use data science tactics to find better and profitable place to sell farming vegies. We will go through each step of this project and address them separately. For this week I just describe the initial data preparation and future steps to start the battle of neighborhoods in Newyork.",
